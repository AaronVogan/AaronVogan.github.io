We study the origin, maintanence, and evolution of virulence in fungi. The current focus revolves around two specific elements: *Spok* genes in species of the cosmopolitan pathogen *Fusarium*, and *Starships*, a novel group of transposable elements that host a vast array of "cargo" genes and are widespread throughout the pezizomycotina.
